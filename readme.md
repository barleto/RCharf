## A ReactiveX implementation for understanding how it works

It's in Java.
I made an RX implementation of Obsevable and observer, for learning pourposes.

## What's in here?

This repository has the result of that study. It has the implementation of Observable and Observer with lots of helpfull methods and classes. It's worth the look to learn how it is implemented!
